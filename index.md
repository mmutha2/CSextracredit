## About


I am a highly disciplined and driven student at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign with concentrations in bioengineering and computer science. 

My understanding of the captivating world that surrounds us is continually molded by the exceptional opportunities I have had. My drive and curiosity in learning and developing skills propels my devotion to such projects and experiences. My focus as an aspiring developer and programmer is on constructing crisp and user-friendly experiences.

## Skills

      Set x = New MicrosoftVisualBasic

**PYTHON**

	prices = {'python': 2.50, 'monkey': 3.50}
	my_purchase = { 'python': 1, 'monkey': 6}
	total_bill = sum(prices[exoticanimals] * my_purchase[exoticanimals]
                   for fruit in my_purchase)
	print 'I owe the sales rep $%.2f' % total_bill

## My Work

**Software Development Intern - AbbVie**
_April 2016 - Current_

- Part of Quick Hits team, which assists in internal and external operations by quickly developing solutions focused on essential and urgent IT needs

- Making enhancements to an existing product using SQL, Visual Basic, TOAD, and Visual Studio

**Research Assistant - Magnetic Resonance Functional Imaging Lab**
_August 2016 - May 2017_

- Performing brain extraction, segmentation, and parsellation of infant brains at approximately 1 month and 3 months of age

- Performing quality control checks: eliminating corrupted data, identifying incomplete data sets, and updating tracking spreadsheet

**Research Assistant - Lifelong Brain and Cognition Laboratory**
_January 2016 - May 2016_

- Assisted post-doc Dr. Erika Hussey in conducting an experiment involving eye-tracking devices, problem solving, and brain plasticity on subjects

- Utilized a variety of cognitive neuroscience approaches that included neuroimaging, computer-based training and trans-cranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) to understand skill acquisition

**Summer Research Intern - UIC Biomechanics Laboratory**
_June 2014 - September 2014_

- Nerve injury occurs in 1-2% of patients who undergo total joint arthroplasty. Injury to the peroneal division of the sciatic nerve is most common, being involved in nearly 80% of the cases.

- The purpose of this study is to compare the histological differences between the peroneal and tibial divisions of the sciatic nerve with or without manual stretching using fresh cadaver material. My experiment focused on the cross-sectional areas of the tibial nerve, in order to be able to compare my data to that of Dr. Amiroucheâ€™s.
 
- If tibial and peroneal divisions of the sciatic nerve are histologically compared, there will be histological differences between the two since the peroneal nerve is less protected and more prone to injury. 

**Summer Research Intern - RUSH University Medical Center**
_June 2013 - September 2013_

- Ovarian cancer is a type of cancer that forms in tissues of the ovary, in which the ova are formed, and occurs when ovarian cells develop in anunrestrained & unnatural manner. Most women are diagnosed at late stages after tumor metastasis and less than 20% survive 5 years. Early detection methods are clearly needed and a substance that could be measured in blood would be efficient, but most tumor proteins have not proven useful. 

- Patients have a characteristic immuneresponse to cancer, that can be measured in blood as auto antibodies. Information on the behavior of specific antibodies and their ability to predict ovarian cancer is needed for antibodies to be used clinically.

- Dr. Luborsky and I designed an experiment to further understand the specific nature of SBP1 (Selenium Binding Protein) in hens with and without ovarian cancer, in the hopes of finding a possible biomarker for ovarian cancer. 

## Photography
Although University life can be extremely hectic, I love exploring my curiosities and passions through traveling, hiking, volunteering, cooking, and photography. Below is a short gallery containing some of my photography, followed by pictures that reflect my love for exploring these curiosities and passions.
